1. 3armstrong: A program to determine if a given number is an Armstrong number, typically for three-digit numbers. It checks if the sum of the cubes of its digits equals the number itself.

2. Anagrams: A script to check if two given strings are anagrams of each other by comparing the character counts.

3. ExtractChar: A program to extract specific characters from a string based on certain conditions (e.g., positions or patterns).

4. Factorial: A program to calculate the factorial of a given number, either iteratively or recursively.

5. GCD: A script to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using an algorithm like Euclid's method.

6. Palindrome: A program to check if a given string or number is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

7. PrimeinaRange: A script to find and display all prime numbers within a given range.
