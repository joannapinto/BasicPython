Basic Programming Questions Repository

This repository contains solutions to fundamental programming problems designed for beginners. Each problem is implemented in a clear and concise manner to help you learn and practice basic programming concepts.

Questions Included

1.	3Armstrong: Determine if a three-digit number is an Armstrong number by checking if the sum of the cubes of its digits equals the number itself.

2.	Anagrams: Check if two strings are anagrams of each other by comparing their character counts.

3.	ExtractChar: Extract specific characters from a string based on conditions, such as positions or patterns.


4.	Factorial: Calculate the factorial of a given number, either iteratively or recursively.

5.	GCD: Compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using Euclid's algorithm.

6.	Palindrome: Check if a string or number is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

7.	PrimeinaRange: Find and display all prime numbers within a given range.

8.	ReverseString: Reverse a given string or number.

9.	LeapYear: Determine if a given year is a leap year based on calendar rules.
