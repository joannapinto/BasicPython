3.	ExtractChar: Write a program to extract specific characters from a string based on certain conditions, such as positions or patterns.

4.	Factorial: Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number, either iteratively or recursively.

5.	GCD: Write a script to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using Euclid's method.

6.	Palindrome: Write a program to check if a given string or number is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

7.	PrimeinaRange: Write a script to find and display all prime numbers within a given range.

8.	ReverseString: Write a program to reverse a given string or number.

9.	LeapYear: Write a program to determine if a given year is a leap year.
